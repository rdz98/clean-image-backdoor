The codes of our paper "Clean-image Backdoor Attacks" are available.

To successfully run the codes, you need to first install some necessary python packages (e.g., torch, vit-pytorch) and download the datasets (MNIST or CIFAR10) to the folder "./data/".

Our experimental logs are also available and saved in the folder "./log/".

Thanks for your interest in our work!
